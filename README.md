# dotnet-specflow
This repository contains sample .NET solutions for implementing SpecFlow. The code of business rules is in Portuguese.

- Solutions: Financeiro, ConversorDistancias, CadastroMusicos.Specs.
- Packages used: SpecFlow, SpecRun.Runner, Selenium WebDriver, Selenium WebDriverBackedSelenium, Selenium Support (Nuget). Obs: the packages used in CadastroMusicos.Specs are Selenium (Support, WebDriver, WebDriver.ChromeDriver) and Specflow (Specflow, MSTest)
- VS Extension: SplecFlow for Visual Studio 2019

Run the tests by running them in Test Explorer on Visual Studio. The plugin of SpecFlow didn't work as well. Obs.: the only project where the tests are working well is CadastroMusicos.Specs.
